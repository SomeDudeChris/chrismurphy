                <h1>About</h1><br>
                <p>Chris Murphy is a singer, educator and programmer who has a passion for classical music and clean code. After graduating from the University of York Chris moved to Oxford to persue a career in singing. As a singer Chris has performed in numerous operas, oratorios and in a variety of different choirs.</p> 
                <p> During the coronavirus pandemic Chris rekindled his childhood love of programming and following a period of intraspection has decided to switch to persue a career in computer programming. Whislt I am still singing in a freelance capacity I am hoping that I can bring my creative flare to new projects and to use many of the transferrable skills I learnt whilst singing, acting and teaching in my new career path. This site is a hub for all of his projects, from singing to coding and everything inbetween. Who knows maybe I'll manage to get in something about my love of cricket or even baking!</p>

                    <p>
                        During the coronavirus pandemic I began coding again as the singing world shut down. What I found is that the satisfaction that I get from solving coding problems is something I feel has been missing in my singing career. Since then I have gone on to create a number of projects and explore a variety of different languages. You can find out more about the projects that I have created in my blog.
